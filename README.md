# Essentials-s 

Essentials-S is yet another Essentials plugin, only this time it is for the Sponge platform. 

The Essentials-S plugin is designed to give your server all essential commands and actions you expect from a server as well as some you don't normally expect.

Features like 

- Chat managment
- World management
- Teleport Requests
- So much more

can all be found in Essentials-S.

## Why Essentials S?

Essentials-S was built from the ground up with Sponge API 8 in mind and designed to work on multiple Sponge API versions. Essentials-S was created due to the passing of ``Nucleus``. 

## Where can I download?

Currently there is no offical download option, however this will be uploaded to the sponge ore page

## How do I use XY or Z?

We have a [Wiki](https://github.com/EssentialsS/Implementation/wiki). If the Wiki does not tell you then please make a [Issue for more documentation](https://github.com/EssentialsS/Implementation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2Ctriage&template=MissingDocumentation.yml&title=%5BWiki%5D%3A+)

## Do you support API 9 and onwards

Currently the focus is on API 8, however API 9 and 10 should work now and will get offical support when ready

## I want to make a plugin around Essentials-S, where are the build dependencies?

Currently there is no maven or gradle dependencies, however there will be soon hosted by jitpack
